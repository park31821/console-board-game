# Console Board Game

A console board game (Connect Four) using C# was implemented to understand the concept of object-oriented programming and design principles.

# Implementation

  1. Two different modes of play (Player vs Player or Computer vs Player)
  2. Checking the validity of moves for human players.
  3. Two different difficulties (Easy and Hard), where easy mode randomly selects a legal move and hard mode select the best move at current state without       considering future consequences
  4. Saving game at any position and loading the game
  5. Undo moves and redo if needed during the game, which is also available to the saved game
  6. Help system that assists users with the rules by opening an online resource during the game
